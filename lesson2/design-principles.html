						<h2><span class="topic-number">1.</span> Visual Hierarchy</h2>
						<p>
							Squeaky wheels get the grease, and prominent visuals get the
							attention. Visual hierarchy is one of the most important
							principles behind good web design. It’s the order in which the
							human eye perceives what it sees.
							<br /><br />Exercise. Please rank the circles in the order of
							importance:
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img src="images/visual-hierarchy-1.jpg" alt="Colorized circles representing visual hierarchy" />
						</div>
						<p>
							Without knowing anything about these circles, you were able to
							rank them easily. That’s a visual hierarchy.
							<br /><br />
							Certain parts of your website are more important than others
							(forms, calls to action, value proposition, etc.), and you want
							those to get more attention than the less important parts.
							<br /><br />
							If you website menu has 10 items, are all of them equally
							important? Where do you want the user to click? Make important
							links more prominent.
							<br /><br />
							Look at this example:
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img
								src="images/visual-hierarchy-2.jpg" alt="Apple's website screeshop as an example of visual hierarchy"
							/>
						</div>
						<p>
							Hierarchy doesn’t come only from size. Apple makes the “Buy”
							call-to-action button more prominent by using color. This is a
							good example using Visual Hierarchy.

						<h2><span class="topic-number">2.</span> Fitt’s Law</h2>
						<p>
							Fitt’s law stipulates that the time required to move to a target
							area (e.g. click a button) is a function of the distance to the
							target and the size of the target. In other words, the bigger an
							object and the closer it is, the easier it is to use.
							<br /><br />
							Spotify makes it easier to hit “Play” than other buttons:
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img src="images/fitt’s-law-1.jpg" alt="Spotify's screenshot as an example of Fitt’s Law" />
						</div>
						<p>
							On the mobile phone app, they also place the play button in an
							easy-to-tap location.
							<br /><br />
							Bigger isn’t always better. A button that takes up half the screen
							isn’t a good idea, and we don’t need a mathematical study to tell
							us. Even so, Fitt’s Law is a binary logarithm. This means that the
							predicted results of the usability of an object run along a curve,
							not a straight line.
							<br /><br />
							A tiny button is much easier to click when given a 20% size
							increase, whereas a very large object, given the same 20% boost in
							size, won’t deliver the same benefits in usability.
							<br /><br />
							This is similar to the rule of target size. The size of a button
							should be proportional to its expected frequency of use. You can
							use mouse tracking to see which buttons people use the most, then
							make popular buttons bigger (easier to hit).
							<br /><br />
							Let’s imagine there’s a form you want people to fill. At the end
							of the form, there are two buttons: “Submit” and “Reset” (clear
							fields).
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img src="images/fitt’s-law-2.jpg" alt="Form buttons as an example of Fitt’s Law" />
						</div>
						<p>
							99.9999% want to hit “Submit.” Hence, the button should be much
							bigger than ‘reset’.
							<br /><br />
							Look at this example:
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img src="images/fitt’s-law-3.jpg" alt="Instagram's screenshot as an example of Fitt’s Law" />
						</div>
						<p>
							All the Instagram main buttons are near to your fingers. It makes
							the use of the app easier and helps you to enjoy the main
							functionalities available.

						<h2><span class="topic-number">3.</span> Hick’s Law</h2>
						<p>
							Hick’s Law says that with every additional choice increases the
							time required to take a decision.
							<br /><br />
							You’ve experienced this countless times at restaurants. Menus with
							huge options make it difficult to choose your dinner. If it
							offered two options, making a decision would take much less time.
							This is similar to the Paradox of Choice—the more choices you
							give, the easier it is to choose nothing. Both principles come
							into play with web design.
							<br /><br />
							The more options a user has on your website, the more difficult it
							is to use (if it’s used at all). We need to eliminate choices. To
							make a better web design, focus on eliminating distracting options
							throughout the design process.
							<br /><br />
							In an era of infinite choice, people need better filters! If you
							sell a huge number of products, add better filters for easier
							decision-making.
							<br /><br />
						</p>
						<div class="article-image">
							<img src="images/hick’s-law-2.jpg" alt="Amazon's screenshot as an example of Hick’s Law" />
						</div>
						<p>
							Amazon is a good example. Using filters to limit the choices
							will make you reach and buy the product you want faster. This law
							is a good one to use in your projects.
