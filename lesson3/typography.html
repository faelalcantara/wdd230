					Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the
					sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same
					illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the
					spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and
					the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose
					upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf
					below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the
					clouds. Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere,
